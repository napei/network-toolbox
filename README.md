# Network Toolbox

<https://networktoolbox.net>

A toolkit for network subnetting of both IPv4 and IPv6 networks. More features coming soon!

Made by a university student who was frustrated by the lack of modern tooling for subnetting. All other tools that I've used in the past provided no way to save/export subnetting settings and share them. When working on a large group assignment, we needed to modify our subnet with over 50 subnets inside it by adding a subnet that would fall in the middle, causing all subnets after to be recalculated. Having a tool that would allow us to save/edit our subnet would have been great.

Subnetting functionality is contained inside the [vlsm-tools](https://github.com/napei/vlsm-tools) library which is also maintained by me.
